    "### The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an analyst at a SaaS company. You've been given a raw table of user events, and your goal is to group these individual events into \"sessions.\" A session is defined as a continuous period of activity by a user where the time between consecutive events does not exceed **30 minutes**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Schema and Sample Data\n",
    "\n",
    "Here is the schema and sample data for our `events` table. The data is crafted to test several edge cases, like single-event sessions and back-to-back sessions for the same user.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Create the table\n",
    "CREATE TABLE events (\n",
    "    event_id INT PRIMARY KEY,\n",
    "    user_id INT,\n",
    "    event_timestamp TIMESTAMP,\n",
    "    event_type VARCHAR(50)\n",
    ");\n",
    "\n",
    "-- Insert sample data\n",
    "INSERT INTO events VALUES\n",
    "-- User 1: Two distinct sessions\n",
    "(1, 101, '2025-09-07 10:00:00', 'page_view'),\n",
    "(2, 101, '2025-09-07 10:05:00', 'click'),\n",
    "(3, 101, '2025-09-07 10:15:00', 'add_to_cart'),\n",
    "(4, 101, '2025-09-07 11:00:00', 'page_view'), -- >30 mins later, new session\n",
    "(5, 101, '2025-09-07 11:02:00', 'click'),\n",
    "\n",
    "-- User 2: One long session\n",
    "(6, 102, '2025-09-07 12:00:00', 'page_view'),\n",
    "(7, 102, '2025-09-07 12:25:00', 'add_to_cart'),\n",
    "(8, 102, '2025-09-07 12:45:00', 'purchase'),\n",
    "\n",
    "-- User 3: A single event session\n",
    "(9, 103, '2025-09-07 13:00:00', 'page_view');\n",
    "\n",

    "*Note: The exact functions for timestamp differences may vary slightly by SQL dialect (e.g., `TIMESTAMPDIFF` in MySQL, subtracting timestamps in PostgreSQL).*\n",

    "### The Challenge: A Three-Part Query\n",
    "\n",
    "Your task is to build a single query that generates a summary of each user session. This is best done by building up the logic step-by-step using Common Table Expressions (CTEs).\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1: Identify Session Starts\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Write a query that, for each event, determines if it is the start of a new session. An event is a \"session start\" if it's the user's very first event or if it occurred more than 30 minutes after their previous event.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skills Tested:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Window Function (`LAG`)**: To look back at a previous row.\n",
    "  * **Timestamp Arithmetic**: To calculate the difference between events.\n",
    "  * `CASE` statements for conditional logic.\n",
    "  * `PARTITION BY` to operate within groups of user events.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2: Assign a Unique Session ID\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Using the \"session start\" flag from Part 1, assign a unique ID to each session. All events within the same session should have the same `session_id`. The ID should be unique per user (e.g., user 101's first session is 1, user 102's first session is 1, etc.).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skills Tested:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Advanced Window Functions**: A conditional cumulative `SUM`, a classic technique for solving \"gaps and islands\" problems.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3: Summarize Each Session\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** With each event now tagged with a `session_id`, aggregate the data to produce a final report with one row per session, showing key metrics.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skills Tested:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `GROUP BY` on multiple columns.\n",
    "  * Aggregate functions (`MIN`, `MAX`, `COUNT`).\n",
    "  * Putting it all together with **CTEs**.\n",
