    "### The Scenario\n",
    "\n",
    "You are an analyst for an e-commerce company. The marketing team wants to launch a new loyalty program and needs your help identifying high-value customers based on their purchasing habits.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Database Schema and Sample Data\n",
    "\n",
    "First, here is the schema and sample data for our four tables: `customers`, `products`, `orders`, and `order_items`. You can run this in any standard SQL environment (like PostgreSQL, MySQL, or an online SQL fiddle) to practice.\n",

    "### The Challenge: A Multi-Part Quest\n",
    "\n",
    "You need to answer a series of questions that build on each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 1: Customer Total Spending\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Write a query to calculate the total amount of money each customer has spent. The result should show the customer's name and their total spending, ordered from highest to lowest.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skills Tested:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `INNER JOIN` across multiple tables.\n",
    "  * `GROUP BY` for aggregation.\n",
    "  * `SUM()` aggregate function.\n",
    "  * `ORDER BY`.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 2: Recent High-Value Customers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** Modify the previous query to identify high-value customers based on their spending **in the year 2024 only**.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skills Tested:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * `WHERE` clause with date filtering.\n",
    "  * Combining filtering with joins and aggregations.\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Part 3: Top Spender in Each Category (The Hard Part)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Goal:** This is the main challenge. Write a query to find the **single top-spending customer for each product category**. The final output should show the category, the customer's name, and the total amount they spent in that category.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Skills Tested:**\n",
    "\n",
    "  * **Common Table Expressions (CTEs)** to build a logical, multi-step query.\n",
    "  * **Window Functions** (`RANK()` or `ROW_NUMBER()`) to rank customers within groups.\n",
    "  * `PARTITION BY` to create windows for ranking.\n",
    "\n",

    "\n",
    "### Solution and Explanation\n",
    "\n",
    "Here are the solutions. It's best to try solving them yourself before looking\\!\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution to Part 1\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    c.name,\n",
    "    SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_spending\n",
    "FROM customers c\n",
    "JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n",
    "JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id\n",
    "JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id\n",
    "GROUP BY c.name\n",
    "ORDER BY total_spending DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution to Part 2\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    c.name,\n",
    "    SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS total_spending_2024\n",
    "FROM customers c\n",
    "JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n",
    "JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id\n",
    "JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id\n",
    "WHERE strftime('%Y', o.order_date) = '2024' -- Use YEAR(o.order_date) in MySQL\n",
    "GROUP BY c.name\n",
    "ORDER BY total_spending_2024 DESC;\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "#### Solution to Part 3\n",
    "\n",
    "This solution uses a CTE and a window function, which is a clean and powerful way to solve this common type of \"ranking within a group\" problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "```sql\n",
    "-- Use a Common Table Expression (CTE) to first calculate spending per customer per category\n",
    "WITH CustomerCategorySpending AS (\n",
    "    SELECT\n",
    "        p.category,\n",
    "        c.name AS customer_name,\n",
    "        SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) AS category_spending,\n",
    "        -- Now, rank customers within each category based on their spending\n",
    "        RANK() OVER(PARTITION BY p.category ORDER BY SUM(p.price * oi.quantity) DESC) as spending_rank\n",
    "    FROM customers c\n",
    "    JOIN orders o ON c.customer_id = o.customer_id\n",
    "    JOIN order_items oi ON o.order_id = oi.order_id\n",
    "    JOIN products p ON oi.product_id = p.product_id\n",
    "    GROUP BY\n",
    "        p.category,\n",
    "        c.name\n",
    ")\n",
    "-- Finally, select only the top-ranked customer from each category\n",
    "SELECT\n",
    "    category,\n",
    "    customer_name,\n",
    "    category_spending\n",
    "FROM CustomerCategorySpending\n",
    "WHERE spending_rank = 1;\n",
    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "**Explanation:**\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **`CustomerCategorySpending` CTE**: We first create a temporary, named result set that calculates how much each customer spent in each category.\n",
    "2.  **`RANK() OVER(...)`**: This is the window function.\n",
    "      * `PARTITION BY p.category`: It tells the function to perform the ranking separately for each category ('Electronics', 'Home Goods', etc.).\n",
    "      * `ORDER BY SUM(...) DESC`: Within each partition, it ranks customers based on their spending in descending order.\n",
    "3.  **Final `SELECT`**: The outer query simply selects from the CTE, filtering for only the rows where `spending_rank` is 1."
