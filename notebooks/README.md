# Jupyter Notebooks

This folder contains Jupyter notebooks organized by problem area. Each subfolder mirrors a major topic in the repository (e.g. `db_admin`, `sql`, `observability`). Use the provided script to install Jupyter and launch the notebook server locally on macOS.

## Launching Jupyter

```
./launch_jupyter.sh
```

The script creates a Python virtual environment in `.venv` and opens a notebook server rooted at the repository's top level so you can access code and data in other folders.
