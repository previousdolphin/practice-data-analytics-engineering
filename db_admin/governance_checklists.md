# Governance Checklists

- Metric stewardship: owner, reviewers, deprecation window, semantic diffs in CI.
- Data contracts: schemas, nullability, ranges, freshness SLOs.
- PII handling: tokenization/consistent IDs; row/column-level security.
- Backfill runbook: tmp tables, swap, lineage announcements.
- Incident response: circuit breakers, rollback, postmortems.
