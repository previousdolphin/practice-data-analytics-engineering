# Analytics Engineering Practice Mini‑Repo

Hands-on practice for SQL, Python ETL, Airflow orchestration, data modeling, governance, and observability — tuned for interview prep **and** on-the-job refreshers.

**Structure**
- `sql/` — 10+ challenges (with HLL/approx percentiles, joins, windows, skew, partitioning), plus solutions.
- `python/` — 10+ challenges for ETL, API ingest, data quality, and cost-aware transforms, plus solutions.
- `airflow/` — quickstart DAG, 5 orchestration challenges, local dev tips.
- `db_admin/` — modeling exercises, governance checklists, cost/perf playbook.
- `sample_data/` — schemas + small CSVs to start; swap with larger data later.
- `experimentation/` — policy replay + A/B metrics exercises.
- `observability/` — data quality tests, monitors, runbooks.
- `semantic_layer/` — starter metrics catalog (dbt/Looker/Omni-friendly).

> Start with `sql/challenges.sql` and `python/challenges.py`. Run `airflow/dags/sample_dag.py` in a local Airflow to stitch it together.
