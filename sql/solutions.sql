-- SQL SOLUTIONS (sketches; adapt to your engine)

-- 1) Window Fundamentals
WITH s AS (
  SELECT user_id,
         MIN(ts) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS first_session_at,
         MAX(ts) OVER (PARTITION BY user_id) AS last_session_at,
         ts
  FROM events
),
w AS (
  SELECT user_id,
         COUNT(*) FILTER (WHERE ts >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '7 day') AS sessions_7d,
         first_session_at, last_session_at
  FROM s
  GROUP BY 1,3,4
)
SELECT * FROM w LIMIT 100;

-- 5) HLL (BigQuery style)
-- CREATE TABLE daily_user_hll AS
-- SELECT dt, HLL_COUNT.INIT(user_id) AS hll_user FROM events GROUP BY dt;
-- SELECT HLL_COUNT.MERGE(hll_user) AS approx_daus
-- FROM daily_user_hll WHERE dt BETWEEN DATE '2025-08-01' AND DATE '2025-08-24';

-- 6) Approx Percentiles (BigQuery)
-- SELECT endpoint,
--        APPROX_QUANTILES(latency_ms, 100)[OFFSET(50)] AS p50,
--        APPROX_QUANTILES(latency_ms, 100)[OFFSET(95)] AS p95
-- FROM api_latencies WHERE dt = CURRENT_DATE GROUP BY endpoint;

-- 8) Smart Accumulation (pseudo)
-- cumulative_today = UNION(cumulative_yesterday, today_delta) with de-dup on primary key
-- Example (Delta/Snowflake MERGE):
-- MERGE INTO cumulative c
-- USING today_delta d ON c.user_id = d.user_id
-- WHEN NOT MATCHED THEN INSERT (user_id, first_seen) VALUES (d.user_id, d.ts)
-- WHEN MATCHED THEN UPDATE SET first_seen = LEAST(c.first_seen, d.ts);

-- 10) Watermarking
-- WHERE dt >= CURRENT_DATE - INTERVAL '3 day'

-- 12) CUPED sketch
-- adj = y - theta*(x - mean(x)); theta = cov(x,y)/var(x)

-- More filled out in real engine later.
