"""PYTHON CHALLENGES (12 tasks)
Use pandas / pyarrow when local, and SQLAlchemy for warehouse connections (mock with SQLite).
Focus on ETL, data quality, sketches, cost-aware transforms.
"""

# 1) CSV -> Parquet ETL with schema enforcement and column pruning.
# 2) Daily incremental load: append-only with idempotency (hash diff) and a 3-day watermark.
# 3) Build HLL sketches for distinct user_id per day using a library (or simple custom bit-sketch) and store as bytes.
# 4) Approx quantiles with t-digest (use 'tdigest' lib or implement a tiny centroid sketch).
# 5) Bloom filter pre-join: create bloom from a small keys list and filter a large CSV before join.
# 6) Count-Min Sketch for top-k referrers with a small heap; compare to exact.
# 7) SCD Type-2 dim builder (effective_start, effective_end, is_current).
# 8) Data quality checks: null %, range checks, referential integrity; output a small HTML report.
# 9) Partition + compaction simulator: write N small parquet files then compact to ~256MB targets.
# 10) Policy replay simulator: replay 30 days with two thresholds, compute moderation load deltas.
# 11) Lightweight lineage tracer: capture input/output file names + row counts in a JSON log.
# 12) Cost estimator: estimate scanned bytes from selected columns and partitions; compare naive vs optimized.
